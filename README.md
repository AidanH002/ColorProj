# ColorProj 🎨

A beautiful React Native color picker app built with Expo - my journey into mobile app development.

## 💡 Project Inspiration

This project was born from my desire to learn React Native and build something visually appealing yet functional. As a developer exploring mobile app development, I wanted to create an app that demonstrates core React Native concepts while providing a practical tool for designers and developers who work with colors daily.

The app serves as both a learning exercise and a useful utility for:
- **Designers** who need quick color references
- **Developers** working on UI/UX projects  
- **Students** learning about color theory and mobile development
- **Anyone** who appreciates clean, intuitive design

## 📱 Features

- **Interactive Color Picker**: Tap colors to select them with smooth animations
- **Modern UI**: Clean and intuitive interface following Material Design principles
- **Real-time Preview**: See selected colors instantly with hex code display
- **Cross-platform**: Consistent experience on iOS, Android, and Web
- **Built with Expo**: Leveraging modern React Native development tools
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts beautifully to different screen sizes
- **Accessibility Ready**: Designed with accessibility principles in mind

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

Through building this app, I gained hands-on experience with:
- **React Native Core Concepts**: Components, state management, and styling
- **Navigation**: Implementing stack navigation with React Navigation
- **Expo Development**: Understanding the Expo development workflow
- **Cross-platform Development**: Building for multiple platforms simultaneously  
- **UI/UX Design**: Creating intuitive and visually appealing interfaces
- **Git Version Control**: Managing code with Git and GitHub integration
